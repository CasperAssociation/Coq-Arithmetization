# Coq-Arithmetization

This is where the formalization work related to [OSL](https://github.com/CasperAssociation/osl) lives. This is a work in progress. The goal is to create a formally verified arithmetic circuit compiler for zero knowledge proving and verification. Soundness (the inability to prove false statements) cannot effectively be tested; it can only be proven.
